Introduction to Spatial Data and Using R as a GIS on Wed 26th April 2017

Hi,

Thank you for signing up to attend the Introduction to Spatial Data & Using R as a GIS course on Wed 26th April. This email includes details of the times and locations of the course. If you have any questions, please contact me (nick@clearmapping.co.uk) or XXXXX.

Registration will take place from 10am in the Room 1.84 GEOPL Computer Lab, School of Geography and Planning, Cardiff University, Glamorgan Building, King Edward VII Avenue, Cardiff CF10 3WA. Details of how to get here are online at: XXXXX. The lunch and other refreshments will be in XXXXX, and I will explain where this is on the day. 

The session will start officially at 10:00am. If you are going to be later than this, please let me know. (A full schedule is included at the end of this email). In the afternoon, there is an opportunity to spend some time working on your own data. If you have any data you are working on, please send me a sample (so I know what type of data to expect) and bring it along and I can have some time with you on a one-to-one basis. 

I would like to share the name, email address and organisation of everyone attending the course with the rest of the participants. The course is a great networking opportunity, and I would like you all to be able to make the most of it. If you do not wish your name and email to be shared in this way, please let me know. I would also like to take some photos during the day and use your feedback as testimonials (for publicity); if you would prefer us not to, please let me know (via email or on the day). 

If you have any learning requirements or dietary preferences you have not already mentioned, please let myself or XXXXX know ASAP. 

If you have any problems on the day, or can't find the room, my mobile number is 07717745715.

I'm looking forward to seeing you on Wednesday 26th April.

Best wishes,
Nick.
